# Java-Plus_Patters
This Java program prints a pulse-like star pattern using nested loops. It takes user input for size via Scanner and creates a vertical line of * at the center column and a horizontal line at the middle row. The program iterates through rows and columns, placing * or spaces based on conditions.
